### Draft


- To improve the user experience, you may want to check for duplicate emails or usernames earlier in the registration flow. For example, as the user types in a username or the input field loses focus. This can help prevent unnecessary form submissions and provide immediate feedback to the user. You can debounce requests with libraries such as use-debounce to manage the frequency of these checks.
